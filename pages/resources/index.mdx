# Introduction
 
Forge is now live on the Evmos mainnet, marking a significant milestone in the DeFi landscape of Evmos. This project is a result of a collaboration between Orbital Apes and EvmosDAO, following a governance proposal that was passed by the Evmos stakeholders to create a community owned protocol. 

## IBC's Premier Uniswap v3 Protocol

Forge DEX stands out as the most capital-efficient exchange in the entire Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) ecosystem, primarily due to our implementation of the Uniswap v3 protocol. 

By adopting the concentrated liquidity feature from Uniswap v3, Forge DEX enables liquidity providers to allocate their assets more effectively within customized price ranges. This approach significantly reduces slippage and increases capital efficiency for all users, resulting in a more competitive and optimal trading experience on the platform.

## Rethinking Capital Efficiency

Uniswap v3 is a pretty damn efficient protocol already, but it doesn't end there for Forge. If you're ready to have your minds blown, read about the ways in which Forge is a unique, [first of a kind Uniswap v3 deployment.](/resources/concepts/capital-efficiency)

## Funded and Owned by the Community

Forge is designed with the community in mind, operating as a community-owned decentralized exchange that charges no protocol fees. This unique approach not only fosters a sense of collective ownership but also encourages greater participation from users. By eliminating protocol fees, Forge DEX aims to create a more accessible and inclusive platform for traders, while promoting transparency and trust within the ecosystem. The community-centric focus of Forge DEX paves the way for a decentralized exchange that remains responsive to the needs and preferences of its users.

## Exciting Interconnected Future

Forge occupies a unique position within the DeFi landscape as an EVM-based chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. This distinctive characteristic enables Forge to bridge the Ethereum and IBC ecosystems together.

Working closely with the Evmos core developers, the development of Forge will be focused on facilitating seamless interoperability, serving as a crucial link that promotes collaboration and communication across different blockchain environments.
