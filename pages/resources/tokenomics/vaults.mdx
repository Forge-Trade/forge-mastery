# Vaults and Staking Programs on Forge

As a platform striving to push the boundaries of what's possible in DeFi, Forge is actively exploring a multitude of potential financial tools, including vaults and staking mechanisms. However, as of the current date, we have not officially launched any vaults or specific staking programs within the Forge ecosystem. This is an area of our roadmap that we are looking to evolve, and we assure our community that we will share more in-depth details as these concepts become more refined and closer to fruition.

## Revert Finance

In the meantime, it's noteworthy to mention our ongoing incentive program in partnership with Revert Finance, which already incorporates a unique staking mechanism. This program rewards users for providing liquidity and participation, a stepping stone toward more extensive staking possibilities on Forge. Detailed information regarding this staking mechanism is readily accessible on Revert Finance's official website.

## Invitation to Projects

We are keenly aware of the broader DeFi landscape and the growing interest from projects seeking to launch vaults and other staking protocols. As a decentralized, community-oriented platform, Forge welcomes all builders and innovators who share our passion for expanding the capabilities of the DeFi ecosystem. We're excited to see what innovative concepts and applications these builders bring to our network.

We are not just spectators in this evolution of DeFi; we aim to be active facilitators and collaborators. As such, we warmly invite builders, developers, and anyone interested in making a meaningful impact on the DeFi landscape to reach out to us. Whether you have questions about our platform, are seeking to understand the integration potential, or wish to explore collaboration opportunities, our team is ready and eager to engage in these discussions. 

## Looking Forward

While Forge is yet to unveil specific vaults and staking programs, our journey is only beginning. With promising collaborations like the one with Revert Finance and an open invitation to builders worldwide, Forge is committed to bringing dynamic, effective, and community-focused financial tools to the Cosmos ecosystem. We are excited about the future and the innovative possibilities that it holds for our platform and the wider DeFi space.
