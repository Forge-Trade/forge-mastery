# Incentive Programs (Ongoing and Planned)

## "Inferno" Community Initiative for Forge Incentives 

The Evmos community has approved a significant governance proposal, "Inferno - An Incentive Program to Bootstrap Liquidity in Forge" which was jointly brought forward by the Evmos DAO, Orbital Apes, and Forge, with the overarching objective of establishing sustainable liquidity and volume on Forge, a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on Evmos.

For the implementation of this program, the community has allocated 3,000,000 Evmos to incentivize liquidity provision on the Forge DEX. Users who provide liquidity can potentially earn from three avenues: staking rewards, liquidity emissions from this program, and LP fees. This multi-reward approach is a first within the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Pool Incentive Tiers and Asset Pairs

The Inferno program is set to span 84 days, segmented into four periods of 21 days each. The program's structure involves three tiers of pool incentives. Tier 1, the highest, will see a daily emission of approximately 9,286 Evmos per pool. Tier 2 pools will have a daily emission of around 2,589 Evmos per pool. The final tier, Tier 3, will distribute approximately 1,339 Evmos daily per pool.

### Stride Liquid Incentives 

Stride DAO has commited to incentivizing the Forge Liquidity Program with an allocation of ~300 STRD / day.



| Tier | Daily Emission per Pool (EVMOS) | Asset Pairs                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | ~9,286                          | stEVMOS/stATOM, stEVMOS/axlUSDC, stEVMOS/axlRETH   |
| 2    | ~2,589                          | stEVMOS/STRD, stATOM/ATOM                          |
| 3    | ~1,339                          | axlUSDC/ceUSDT, axlRETH/axlWETH                    |

## Vesting Mechanism for Incentives

Regarding the vesting mechanism for rewards, Inferno has incorporated a linear vesting period in partnership with Revert Finance to ensure a fair distribution. The vesting calculation occurs when users unstake their position, making sure that rewards are proportionate to the period of liquidity provision.

Adaptability is a key aspect of this program. If a pool's liquidity does not meet expectations, adjustments may be made to the allocation per pool. These changes will be communicated transparently within the community.
