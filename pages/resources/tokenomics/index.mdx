# Community Owned & Striving for Self-Sustainability

At the heart of the Evmos DAO, one of our core principles is the belief in fostering self-sustaining projects. Aligned with this conviction, our long-term objective for Forge is to develop it into a standalone, self-sustaining decentralized exchange (DEX) that continuously grows, adapts, and contributes to the broader ecosystem.

## Taking the First Steps

The Evmos community has passed a proposal to provide liquidity of the to the main stEVMOS/EVMOS pair on Forge in Proposal 142. The proposal requested 2M Evmos, with 1M Evmos allocated for liquid staking. 

The liquidity pool is currently actively managed by the Evmos DAO, OA + two trusted and active community members, which is 100% transparent and viewable on the block explorer. 

The rewards generated from liquid staking and the Forge liquidity pool (LP fees) will be directed to the multisig wallet. A portion of the rewards will be used to cover the operational costs of the DEX to ensure long-term sustainability and growth, and the remaining rewards will be allocated for Forge bounties. The requested funds only provision liquidity to Forge, and the position must be adjusted on a regular basis.

## An Unconventional Philosophy

Key to understanding Forge's philosophy and strategy is acknowledging that Forge does not operate on the typical mechanisms seen in some other DEXs. Uniquely, Forge does not have an investment token, nor does it conduct airdrops. Even more so, the protocol fees within Forge are set to 0%. These decisions underline our commitment to ensuring that Forge is not a tool for individual profit but a community-owned public good. 

Forge's primary role is to serve as a catalyst for growth and innovation within the Evmos ecosystem. By aligning our operations with this mission, we believe that we can deliver a platform that truly serves its community. This orientation away from individual profits towards a public good signals a renewed focus on long-term growth and the health of the Evmos ecosystem.

## Looking Forward 

The journey towards self-sustainability is an ongoing process that requires steadfast commitment and a community-centric approach. Through initiatives like Proposal 142 and the inherent community-focused design of Forge, we continue to move closer to our goal. We are excited about the future and the potential it holds for further establishing Forge as a cornerstone of the Evmos ecosystem and a leader in the DEX space.
