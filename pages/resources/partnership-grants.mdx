## Partnerships & Collaborations

At Forge, we believe in the power of synergy and collaboration to drive innovation and growth. As we continue to expand the Evmos ecosystem, we are actively seeking partnerships and collaborations that align with our mission to foster a thriving, community-owned DEX. 

We are open to new ideas and proposals that can propel Forge and the Evmos network to new heights.  Our goal is to create an ecosystem where diverse protocols and creative DeFi can flourish together, ultimately benefiting the Evmos Community and the wider IBC and EVM world.

One of our primary focuses is on partnerships that will help build liquidity on our DEX. We aim to create a vibrant ecosystem that offers competitive trading opportunities and encourages participation from a wide range of users.

In addition to liquidity-focused collaborations, we are highly interested in incentive programs that can attract and retain users on Forge. We believe that rewarding users for their participation and engagement is crucial for fostering a loyal and active community. If you have innovative ideas for incentive schemes or strategies that can enhance user experience and drive adoption, we would be thrilled to hear it!
