# **How to Remove Liquidity**

Step 1: **Connect Your Wallet.** Go to https://forge.trade and click on "Add Liquidity" at the top of the page. Connect your wallet if you haven't already.

Step 2: **Find Your Position.** Under "Your Positions," you'll see a list of all the liquidity you've provided. Next, find the position you want to remove liquidity from and click on that pair.

Step 3: **Remove Liquidity.** Click on the "Remove Liquidity" button on the right side of the page. You can choose to remove a certain percentage or all of your liquidity. Once you've decided on the amount, then click "Remove."

Step 4: **Confirm Removal.** Click "Remove" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Your liquidity will be removed, and the tokens returned to your wallet once the transaction finalizes. 

Removing liquidity may be appropriate when you believe that the price of the tokens in your pool is likely to move outside of your specified range or when you want to realize the fees you've earned. Keep in mind that removing liquidity may have tax implications.
