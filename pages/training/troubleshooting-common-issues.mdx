# **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

Here are some common issues you might encounter while using Forge and how to troubleshoot them:



* **Transaction Failed**: This can happen due to insufficient gas fees, price movement (slippage), or network congestion. Try increasing the gas fee, adjusting the slippage tolerance, or waiting for the network to be less congested.
* **Insufficient Output Amount Error**: This occurs when the price changes between the time of transaction approval and execution. Increasing your slippage tolerance can solve this issue.
* **Wallet Connection Issues**: If you're having trouble connecting your wallet, try refreshing the page, switching browsers, or clearing your browser cache.
* **Liquidity Position Not Showing**: If your liquidity position isn't showing, it could be a network error. Check your transactions on https://escan.live to ensure they were successful, and try refreshing the page.

Remember that using DeFi platforms involves risks. Always double-check transactions, be wary of high slippage settings, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
