# **How to Swap Tokens on Forge**

Step 1: **Connect Your Wallet**. Go to https://forge.trade. Click on "Connect" in the top right corner. You can connect using MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect (for wallets like Trust Wallet).

Step 2: **Select Tokens**. Once your wallet is connected, choose the token you wish to swap from and the token you want to receive. If the token isn't listed, you can add a custom token by pasting the contract address into the search field.

Step 3: **Enter Amount.** Enter the amount of the token you want to swap. The Forge interface will automatically calculate the amount of the other token you'll receive based on the current exchange rate.

Step 4: **Adjust Slippage Tolerance.** Slippage tolerance accounts for changes in price between when you start a transaction and when it gets confirmed on the blockchain. You can adjust this in the settings. Be aware that a higher slippage tolerance increases the likelihood of your transaction getting through but may result in a less favorable rate.

Step 5: **Confirm Swap.** Click on "Swap" and then "Confirm Swap." A MetaMask (or other wallet) window will pop up, asking you to confirm the transaction.

Step 6: **Confirm Transaction.** Confirm the transaction in your wallet. Once confirmed, your swap will be executed.
