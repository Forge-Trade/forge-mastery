# **Risk Management**

LPs should always research and understand the risks involved in providing liquidity. Diversifying across different pairs, regularly monitoring positions, and investing only what one can afford to lose are crucial to risk management.

Remember, advanced strategies involve more risk and should only be used by users who fully understand them and are willing to take on the associated risks. Always do your own research and consider seeking advice from financial advisors.
