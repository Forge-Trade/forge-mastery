# **Advanced Strategies**

Forge offers Concentrated Liquidity, allowing Liquidity Providers (LPs) to allocate their capital within custom price ranges. Concentrated Liquidity opens up a range of new strategies for LPs. Here are some advanced strategies for maximizing returns and minimizing risks:



1. **Focused Liquidity Provision**: LPs can focus their liquidity within a specific price range in Forge. This is a significant advantage over Uniswap V2, where liquidity is distributed evenly across all prices.

    By focusing liquidity within a narrow price range close to the current price, LPs can provide the same depth of liquidity (or trading volume) with less capital, thereby increasing capital efficiency and potential returns from fees.


    For instance, if an LP believes that the price of ETH/USDC will stay between $1700 and $2000, they can decide to provide liquidity only within this range. The narrower this range, the more fees they would earn per dollar of capital, assuming the price stays within this range.


    However, this strategy comes with increased risk. If the price moves outside of the specified range, LPs will no longer earn fees, and their position will be fully converted into either ETH or USDC, depending on the direction of the price movement. This can result in significant impermanent loss if the price never returns to the specified range.

2. **Multi-Position Strategies**: Forge allows LPs to provide liquidity in multiple price ranges, which can help create a more customized risk-return profile.

    For example, an LP could divide their capital into different portions and allocate each to a different price range. They could put a small amount of capital in a narrow range close to the current price for high returns and a larger amount in a broader range for more stability. This strategy allows the LP to earn high fees when the price is volatile within the narrow range and still earn some fees and avoid a complete conversion to one token when the price moves outside the narrow range.


    This approach can be particularly beneficial in volatile markets, allowing LPs to maximize returns while mitigating risks.

3. **Dynamic Liquidity Provision**: Given the flexibility of Forge, LPs have the opportunity to adjust their price ranges based on market conditions actively.

    For example, if an LP anticipates a significant upward price movement for ETH/USDC, they could move their liquidity to a higher price range. This would allow them to continue earning fees as the price increases, capture the price appreciation of ETH, and mitigate impermanent loss. However, this strategy requires active management and a good understanding of market conditions.


    Remember, while these strategies can help maximize returns and minimize risks, they involve more complexity and potential risks. LPs should carefully consider these factors and thoroughly research before deciding on a strategy.



## **Concentrated Liquidity in Comparison to Limit Orders**

Forge's concentrated liquidity provision allows liquidity providers (LPs) to set custom price ranges within which their liquidity is active. This feature can simulate the functionality of limit orders in traditional finance, albeit with a few key differences.

In a traditional limit order, a trader sets the specific price at which they want to buy or sell an asset. Once the market price hits that specific price, the order is executed.

In Forge, when an LP sets a price range for their liquidity, they state that they are willing to buy or sell tokens at any price within that range. When the market price moves into their range, their liquidity is used for trades, earning them fees.

Now, if the market price moves beyond their range in one direction, their liquidity is no longer used for trades until the price comes back into their range. Furthermore, as the price moves beyond their range, their liquidity position will gradually convert into the token depreciating in price.

For example, let's say you're providing liquidity to an ETH/USDC pool, and you set your price range such that you provide liquidity when 1 ETH is between 1700 USDC and 2000 USDC. If the price of ETH rises above 2000 USDC, your liquidity pool share will gradually convert into 100% USDC (as traders are swapping USDC for ETH, driving the price up). In this scenario, you've essentially sold your ETH at prices between 1700 and 2000 USDC, similar to a limit sell order in traditional finance.

Conversely, if the price of ETH falls below 1700 USDC, your liquidity pool share will gradually convert into 100% ETH (as traders are swapping ETH for USDC, driving the price down). Here, you've essentially bought ETH at prices between 1700 and 2000 USDC, similar to a limit buy order.

This mechanism allows LPs to automate their buying and selling based on their price expectations, much like limit orders. However, it's important to note that if the price never returns to their range, their position will remain 100% in the token that depreciated in price, which could lead to impermanent loss if the price of that token continues to fall. Also, unlike limit orders, LPs earn fees for trades that occur within their price range, providing an additional incentive.
