# **How to Add Liquidity**

Step 1: **Connect Your Wallet.** Go to https://forge.trade and click on "Add Liquidity" at the top of the page, then click "New Position." Connect your wallet if you haven't already.

Step 2: **Select Tokens.** Choose the tokens you want to provide liquidity for. You need to select two tokens for a liquidity pair.

Step 3: **Set Price Range.** Unlike Uniswap V2, you can set a price range for your liquidity in Forge. The tokens you provide will only be used for trades within this price range.

Step 4: **Enter Amount.** Decide how much of each token you want to deposit. Remember, you need to add an equal value of both tokens.

Step 5: **Review and Add Liquidity.** Review your position; if everything looks good, click "Preview" to further confirm details. Click "Add" to provide your tokens to the liquidity pool.
