# Project / Token Listing

## Pool Creation

Creating a pool for your project's token is permissionless and does not require any middleman.

## Token Listing

The token list is managed by an open source repository which you can find [here.](https://github.com/Forge-Trade/tokenlist)

### General Requirements
1. Token should be verified on the [eScan.live](https://escan.live/) or [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/evmos) explorer.
2. Token must be added to a list that it qualifies for:
    * **Mainnet Tokenlist**: Token must be on the Evmos network (9001).
    * **Testnet Tokenlist**: Token must be on the Evmos testnet (9000).


## Adding Your Token
1. Add an entry in the `tokens` field of the appropriate tokenlist. Here is an example using WEVMOS:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Wrapped Evmos",
      "symbol": "WEVMOS",
      "chainId": 9001,
      "decimals": 18,
      "address": "0xD4949664cD82660AaE99bEdc034a0deA8A0bd517",
      "logoURI": "https://storage.googleapis.com/us-central1-dgc-berlin-0-470cbba9-bucket/tokenlist/wevmos.png"
    }
    ```
2. Update the `timestamp` field to the current timestamp.
3. Update the `version` field to adhere to semantic versioning:

    * Increment major version when tokens are removed
    * Increment minor version when tokens are added
    * Increment patch version when tokens already on the list have minor details changed (name, symbol, logo URL, decimals)

    ***Note:*** Changing a token address or chain ID is considered both a remove and an add, and should be a major version update.

4. Create a PR with your project and token information and wait for approval

We reserve the right to deny tokens that may cause harm to the Evmos Community.
