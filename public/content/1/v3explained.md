#  Understanding Uniswap V1, V2, and V3

In this video, the speaker explains the differences between Uniswap versions 1, 2, and 3. The speaker also discusses how Uniswap works using liquidity pools and smart contracts.

## Uniswap V1

- Uniswap V1 uses smart contracts to allow traders to trade with a pool of money at any point in time with very low fees.
- The price of Ethereum affects the amount charged by the pool for trading.
- Investors deposit money into liquidity pools which are used for trading.

## Uniswap V2

- Uniswap V2 allows for creating pools that don't need Ethereum.
- This version allows swapping tokens with one click.
- A decent understanding of decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, automated market makers, and impermanent loss is required to understand the changes in v3.

## Uniswap V3

- V3 was launched around March 2021 on both the Ethereum mainnet as well as the optimism main net.
- V3's big update is called concentrated liquidity which means providing more control over pricing curves.

In this section, we will learn about liquidity pools and how they work in Uniswap V3.

## Providing Liquidity

- When you put money into a Uni-swap pair like USDC or Ethereum, you lend your assets to the pool. 
- The pool lets other traders trade your assets back and forth, collecting small fees from those traders. 
- By providing liquidity, your money is evenly spread for traders to use between the prices of zero dollars and infinity dollars. 
- With V3, instead of letting your assets be spread thin across all price ranges, you can now select where you want to deploy your concentrated liquidity. 

## Concentrated Liquidity

- Concentrated liquidity allows you to choose where to deploy your capital within a specific price range. 
- This means that if Ethereum goes up or down in price, the money that you provided is fairly allocated across all price ranges.
- By supplying between the ranges of three thousand dollars and four thousand dollars, for example, you are effectively placing a three thousand dollar Ethereum limit sell order and a four thousand dollar limit buy order. 

## Capital Multiplier

- Concentrated liquidity can multiply your capital by allowing you to earn more fees than with evenly spread liquidity. 
- For example, if two people invest ten thousand dollars each but one uses concentrated liquidity while the other uses even spread liquidity, the person using concentrated liquidity could earn over eight times more fees.
- However, there is still a risk of impermanent loss when using concentrated liquidity.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Uniswap V3 offers new features such as concentrated liquidity that allow users to earn more fees and have more control over their investments. By understanding how liquidity pools work, users can make informed decisions about where to invest their money.
#  Understanding Uniswap V3

In this video, the speaker explains how Uniswap V3 works and its features. The speaker covers active liquidity, NFTs, licensing, and future developments.

## Active Liquidity

-  Providing liquidity to a range of $25-$35 with two tokens will result in instant conversion to one token if the price drops out of that range.
- If the price keeps dropping, your liquidity becomes inactive and you won't earn any fees or change due to impermanent loss.

## NFTs

-  LP tokens are given to liquidity providers or investors as proof that they provided money to a specific pool.
- With price ranges in Uniswap V3, specific data must be attached to LP tokens using NFTs.
- Different NFTs can represent different price ranges for LP tokens.

## Licensing

-  Uniswap V3 has licensing that protects their code for two years.
- This means other exchanges cannot copy or fork their code without permission.

## Future Developments

-  The speaker suggests a passive income feature for UniSwap token holders where a small portion of all fees on UniSwap goes back into buying UniSwap tokens. 
- This should mean that the price appreciates and would give more reason for investors to buy UniSwap.
